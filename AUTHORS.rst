* Tetiana Ovchynnykova - Senior Maths teacher. This scientific work would not be written without her. Most importantly, she built the foundation of the analytical, logically correct thinking I hope I have.
* Dmytro Ovchynnykov - Senior Node/AWS engineer. Great thanks for architectural solutions and support in preparation for defending this project in Minor Academy of Sciences of Ukraine.
* Bohdan Feshchenko - Junior researcher at Institute of Mathematics. Thanks for the taught course "Basics of higher mathematics" which deepened the connection between Maths and programming.
